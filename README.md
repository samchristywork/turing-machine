## Overview

You can find an explanation of what a Turing machine is [on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine). This program takes a
description of a Turing machine as a JSON file, and runs it, printing out the
state of the machine at each step and continuing until some condition has been
reached, such as an error state, a halting state, or a set number of steps have
been reached.
